## Overview

The Lähitaksi Taxi Meter Simulation is an educational Unity project that simulates a real-world taxi meter system. It models taxi operations such as configurable pricing, trip management, real-time fare calculation and payments.

The project focuses on flexible, data-driven system design, allowing the simulation to be extended or adapted to different pricing rules and scenarios.

## Features

- Configurable fare categories and time-based pricing (e.g., different fare-types, evening and weekend rates)  
- Real-time meter updates and fee calculation  
- Data-driven architecture using JSON for fares and pricing rules  
- Monitoring of trip and meter status

## Notes

- The project was developed as part of an internship collaboration with Lähitaksi for educational purposes.
- The project is not finished and is presented here mainly as a part of my portfolio.
